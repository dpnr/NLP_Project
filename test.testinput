   CLANDESTINE, 8 JAN 90 (RADIO VENCEREMOS) -- [STATION COMMENTARY]
[TEXT] GOODBYE [AIR FORCE COMMANDER] GENERAL RAFAEL BUSTILLO, FALSE
HOPE FOR MASS KILLERS.  GEN.  BUSTILLO RESIGNS OR IS MADE TO RESIGN AS
THE AIR FORCE CHIEF.  BECAUSE OF THIS, THE GENERAL IS ADMITTING THAT
WITHOUT THE BOMBING ON SAN SALVADOR'S NEIGHBORHOODS THE FMLN
[FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT] WOULD HAVE DEFEATED THE
SALVADORAN ARMED FORCES.  BUSTILLO'S RESIGNATION IS YET ANOTHER SIGN
OF THE FAILURE OF 10 YEARS OF THE U.S. COUNTERINSURGENCY POLICY IN EL
SALVADOR, AS BECAME CLEAR WITH THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED ON 10 NOVEMBER.

   FOR 10 YEARS THE MILITARY AND THEIR U.S. SPONSORS BASED THEIR TRUST IN THE
AIR POWER TO DROWN IN BLOOD THE ASPIRATION OF THE NATION TO ACHIEVE
DEMOCRACY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE.  THIS FIRST HAPPENED IN THE INTERIOR OF THE
COUNTRY, WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF DOZENS OF TOWNS LIKE TENANCINGO, BERLIN,
TOROLA, SAN FERNANDO, AND SO MANY OTHERS THAT TOOK PLACE ALONG WITH THE
GENOCIDE CARRIED OUT BY THE INFANTRY WITH THE MASS MURDERS OF CIVILIANS IN
EL MOSOTO, SUNPUL, AND OCOTAPAYO.  BUSTILLO IS LEAVING AS SO MANY GENERALS
AND U.S. AMBASSADORS HAVE.  AND LIKE ALL OF THEM HIS DEPARTURE REVEALS THE
IMPERIALIST POWER'S FAILURE TO CONSOLIDATE ITS COUNTERINSURGENCY PROGRAM IN
EL SALVADOR.

   AS ALL THE OTHERS WHO HAVE LEFT, BUSTILLO ALSO SEEKS EXCUSES IN THE FACE
OF HIS FAILURE, BY ACCUSING OTHERS.  HE ACCUSES [FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER
EUGENIO] VIDES CASANOVA OF BEING SOFT IN FIGHTING THE PEOPLE'S PLAN.  ONE
WOULD HAVE TO ASK BUSTILLO IF THE AIR FORCE, OF WHICH HE REPRESENTED ITS
MOST ENCOURAGING PILLAR, WAS SOFT WHEN IT MURDERED 70,000 SALVADORANS,
MONSIGNOR ARNULFO ROMERO AND THE JESUIT PRIESTS INCLUDED, AND EVEN WHEN IT
MURDERED PATRIOT OFFICERS OF THAT SAME ARMY.  WAS THE U.S. PENTAGON SOFT
WHEN IT GAVE $3 BILLION, WEAPONS, AND BOMBS FOR THE MOST COWARDLY ACT OF
GENOCIDE LATIN AMERICA CAN RECALL THIS CENTURY?

   THE U.S. STRATEGY, IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE TOP MILITARY COMMAND IN THE
PAST 10 YEARS WITH ALL ITS MIGHT DID ALL IT COULD SO THAT THE PERMANENT
REBELLION IN THE RURAL AREAS REACHED THE COUNTRY'S VITAL CENTERS, AS INDEED
HAPPENED AS OF THE 10 NOVEMBER OFFENSIVE.  BUSTILLO STATES IT CLEARLY.

   THE BOMBING TEMPORARILY HALTED THE DEFEAT OF THE TOP COMMAND.  THROUGH AN
ACT OF GENOCIDE, IT MANAGED TO REMOVE THE DISGRUNTLED PEOPLE FROM THE
NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE GUERRILLA FORCES WERE.  BUSTILLO ACKNOWLEDGES
GENOCIDE IS THE SOLE WAY THE ARMED FORCES CAN SURVIVE.  BUSTILLO
ACKNOWLEDGES THE FMLN'S STRENGTH AND THEREFORE URGES THE ARMED FORCES TO BE
TOUGHER AND INFLEXIBLE AND REJECTS A POLITICAL SOLUTION TO THE CONFLICT.  A
POLITICAL SOLUTION WOULD EXPRESS THE CONSENSUS AMONG THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR
SECTORS.  OBVIOUSLY THE TOP COMMAND REPRESENTS A DECADENT MINORITY.
BUSTILLO SUPPORTS LAUNCHING A FASCIST CRUSADE AGAINST THE PEOPLE'S WISH FOR
DEMOCRACY.  IN THIS EFFORT, HE LASHES OUT AT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, ALL
OPPOSITION SECTORS THAT REPORT HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS, AND ALL SECTORS THAT
SUPPORT DEMOCRATIZING THE COUNTRY.  IN CONCLUSION, WE SAY THAT BUSTILLO IS
NOT RESIGNING OF HIS OWN VOLITION.  THE FMLN ACTION ELIMINATED BUSTILLO AS
IT ELIMINATED GARCIA, VIDES, AND SO MANY OTHER MILITARY CHIEFS WHO LEFT
THEIR POSTS WITHOUT FULFILLING THE TASK COMMISSIONED BY THE UNITED STATES:
TO STOP THE FMLN.

   THE FMLN OFFENSIVE BARED THE GENOCIDAL, ANTIPOPULAR, AND FASCIST NATURE OF
THE ALFREDO CRISTIANI REGIME TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT PROMPTED A STRONG
DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES ON CUTTING MILITARY AID.  THE JESUITS' MURDERS
AND THE BOMBINGS SO SHOOK THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY THAT IT IS PRESSURING
FOR PUNISHMENT OF THE OFFICERS INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS.  HOWEVER, THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION ACCEPTED THIS, SINCE COLONEL RENE EMILIO PONCE [CHAIRMAN
OF THE JOINTS CHIEFS OF STAFF] AND HIS CLIQUE, EVEN CRISTIANI, MUST SHOULDER
THIS RESPONSIBILITY.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT IN COSTA RICA THE SALVADORAN
DEFENSE MINISTER DISCLOSED CRISTIANI AUTHORIZED THE BOMBINGS.

   BUSH NEEDED A SCAPEGOAT TO PLACE IT ON THE ALTAR OF THE DEBATES WHICH WILL
BEGIN IN THE U.S. CONGRESS ON THE FATE OF MILITARY AID.  BUSTILLO IS BUSH'S
SCAPEGOAT.  HOWEVER, BUSTILLO WAS ALREADY A USELESS ELEMENT OF THE MURDEROUS
MACHINERY THAT REMAINS ACTIVE.  WILL THE U.S. PUBLIC AND CONGRESS BE
APPEASED WITH THIS FOUL TASTING CANDY?  TIME AND THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES ARE
OBVIOUSLY RUNNING AGAINST THE FASCIST PROGRAM IN EL SALVADOR.  WHILE PEOPLES
OF THE WORLD TEAR DOWN DOGMAS, DICTATORSHIPS, AND WALLS, BUSTILLO, WHO
LEAVES THROUGH THE DOOR OF DEFEAT, ASKS THE ARMED FORCES TO BE TOUGHER,
COMMIT MORE GENOCIDE, AND BUILD MORE WALLS OF REPRESSION AGAINST THE CHURCH,
THE PEOPLE, AND THE NATION AS A WHOLE.  GOODBYE, GEN. BUSTILLO.  WE CONTINUE
WRITING HISTORY WITHOUT YOU.  THE DECADE WE BEGIN IS OF DEMOCRACY,
INDEPENDENCE, AND SELF-DETERMINATION.  THAT IS WHY FOREIGN INTERVENTION AND
THE WALLS OF INTOLERANCE HAVE A SHORT LIFE SPAN IN THIS COUNTRY, WHERE THE
PEOPLE GROW IN HEROISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IS NOT DETERRED BY
BOMBINGS.

   ROME (ITALY), 11 JAN 90 -- [INTERVIEW WITH DEMOCRATIC CONVERGENCE
LEADER RUBEN ZAMORA BY ALESSANDRO OPPES] [EXCERPT] [PASSAGE OMITTED]
[OPPES] THE FARABUNDO MARTI NATIONAL LIBERATION FRONT [FMLN] HAS
DESCRIBED THE ARREST OF FIVE SOLDIERS ACCUSED OF COMMITTING THE
MASSACRE [OF SIX JESUIT PRIESTS] AS "A MANIPULATED COVER OPERATION."
BASICALLY, CRISTIANI IS ALLEGED TO HAVE DECIDED TO PUNISH A NUMBER OF
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS TO CLOSE THE CASE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND TO
END INTERNATIONAL PRESSURES.  WHAT IS YOUR OPINION IN THIS REGARD?

   [ZAMORA] THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT CRISTIANI ACKNOWLEDGES THAT MEMBERS OF
THE ARMY WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MASSACRE IS A FIRST STEP AND DEFINITELY A
GOOD THING, BUT IT IS ENTIRELY INSUFFICIENT UNLESS THE SUBSEQUENT STEPS ARE
ALSO TAKEN.  FIRST, TO IDENTIFY WHO THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WERE:  THIS IS
THE FIRST IMPORTANT POINT, BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FEEL SATISFIED IF ONLY
LOW-RANKING OFFICERS ARE IDENTIFIED.  SUCH AN ACT CAN ONLY HAVE BEEN ORDERED
BY HIGH-RANKING OFFICERS.  WE MUST NOT FORGET THE MURDER OF MONSIGNOR ROMERO,
FOR WHICH THERE WERE NO SENTENCES AND NO TRIALS.

   [OPPES] HOWEVER, THE ARMED FORCES HIGH COMMAND IMMEDIATELY DENIED
INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATION, STATING THAT IT WAS AN ISOLATED ACTION
"DIVORCED FROM ANY INSTITUTIONAL POLICY."

   [ZAMORA] I BELIEVE THIS IS ENTIRELY WRONG: THE MURDER OF THE JESUIT
FATHERS CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AN ISOLATED ACTION.  OVER 7,000 PEOPLE HAVE
DIED IN EL SALVADOR DURING 10 YEARS OF CIVIL WAR, AND 90 PERCENT OF THEM WERE
CIVILIANS.  POLITICAL ASSASSINATION BY THE GOVERNMENT FORCES IS A CONSTANT
PRACTICE.  FURTHERMORE, TORTURE IS REGULARLY PRACTISED IN EL SALVADOR.  THE
ARMY HIGH COMMAND CANNOT FAIL TO KNOW THIS.  THEY CANNOT CLAIM TO BE
INNOCENT, BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE GREATEST RESPONSIBILITIES FOR HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLATIONS.

   [OPPES] YET LAST MONTH THE SUMMIT OF CENTRAL AMERICAN HEADS OF STATE IN
SAN JOSE ENDED WITH A SUCCESS FOR PRESIDENT CRISTIANI, WHO SECURED AN
EXPLICIT CONDEMNATION OF THE OFFENSIVE LAUNCHED BY THE GUERRILLAS IN
NOVEMBER, WHEREAS NO SPECIFIC CHARGES WERE LEVELED AT THE GOVERNMENT FOR
HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS.

   [ZAMORA] THERE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND, NAMELY,
THE CALL FROM THE FIVE PRESIDENTS FOR A RESUMPTION OF THE DIALOGUE IN EL
SALVADOR AND THE APPEAL TO THE UN SECRETARY GENERAL TO CARRY OUT MEDIATION
TO THIS END.  BUT IN THE SUMMIT'S FINAL DOCUMENT, IT IS THE FMLN AND THE
NICARAGUAN CONTRAS WHO PAY THE PRICE FOR THE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PRESIDENTS:
THESE ARE DIPLOMATIC GAMES THAT DO NOT FACILITATE THE RESTORATION OF PEACE
IN CENTRAL AMERICA.

   [OPPES] WHAT PATHS CAN BE TAKEN NOW TO ADVANCE THE NEGOTIATIONS?

   [ZAMORA] NEGOTIATIONS ARE BECOMING INCREASINGLY NECESSARY.  THE GUERRILLA
OFFENSIVE SHOWS THAT THE FMLN IS A STRONG MILITARY FORCE, BUT ALSO THAT A
REVOLUTIONARY ATTITUDE DOES NOT EXIST AMONG THE MASSES.  IT ALSO SHOWS THAT
THE GOVERNMENT ARMY, AFTER 10 YEARS OF U.S. TRAINING, IS AN ARMY WHOSE
MILITARY STANCE IS DEFENSIVE, NOT OFFENSIVE (WHICH IS THE KEY TO U.S.
MILITARY STRATEGY.)  WHILE THIS ALL SHOWS THAT THERE CAN ONLY BE A
NEGOTIATED SOLUTION TO THE CRISIS, IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT PRECISELY FOLLOWING
THE GUERRILLA OFFENSIVE (AND THIS IS THE PARADOX) THE ARMY STIFFENED ITS
STANCE AGAINST NEGOTIATIONS.  I BELIEVE THAT SOONER OR LATER COMMON SENSE
WILL PREVAIL AND IT WILL SIT DOWN AT THE NEGOTIATING TABLE.  AT THE END OF
NOVEMBER THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE'S ASSISTANT FOR LATIN AMERICA SPOKE
OFFICIALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO RESOLVE THE
CRISIS IN EL SALVADOR: THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SIGN OF A CHANGING SITUATION.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 (ACAN-EFE) -- [TEXT] THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT
TODAY DEPLORED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC LEADER HECTOR OQUELI
COLINDRES THIS MORNING IN GUATEMALA.

   NATIONAL INFORMATION SECRETARY MAURICIO SANDOVAL TOLD ACAN-EFE THAT "IT IS
REGRETTABLE," ADDING THAT THE SALVADORAN GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY
EFFORTS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION ON THE CASE.

   ACCORDING TO SOURCES FROM HIS PARTY, HECTOR OQUELI COLINDRES, ASSISTANT
SECRETARY OF THE NATIONAL REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR) DISAPPEARED TODAY IN
GUATEMALA WHEN THE VEHICLE IN WHICH HE WAS TRAVELING WAS INTERCEPTED BY
HEAVILY ARMED MEN WEARING CIVILIAN CLOTHING.

   AN MNR SPOLESMAN REPORTED THAT OQUELI COLINDRES WAS "KIDNAPPED" AS HE WAS
HEADING TO THE AIRPORT IN GUATEMALA CITY TO TAKE A FLIGHT TO NICARAGUA,
WHERE HE WOULD JOIN A SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL DELEGATION THAT IS CURRENTLY
IN THAT COUNTRY TO OBSERVE THE ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN.

   MNR SPOKESMEN SAID THAT THE GUATEMALAN POLICE FOUND THE VEHICLE IN WHICH
OQUELI WAS TRAVELING WITH A MEMBER OF THE GUATEMALAN SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
WITHOUT ITS OCCUPANTS.

   SAN SALVADOR, 12 JAN 90 (AFP) -- [TEXT] SALVADORAN COLONEL SIGIFREDO
OCHOA PEREZ TODAY SAID THAT THE MASTERMINDS OF THE SIX JESUIT PRIESTS'
MURDER ARE NOT "SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," BUT ARE "MUCH HIGHER IN THE
HIERARCHY."

   "REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS A GENERAL OR COLONEL, WHOEVER MASTERMINDED
THIS CRIME MUST BE PUNISHED," THE RANKING LEADER OF THE RULING ARENA
[NATIONALIST REPUBLICAN ALLIANCE] PARTY AND RETIRED OFFICER SAID DURING A
TELEVISED INTERVIEW. 

   THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MULTIPLE MURDER THAT TOOK PLACE ON 16 NOVEMBER
"ARE NOT SOLDIERS OR LIEUTENANTS," HE SAID.

   "THIS ACTION INVOLVED MUCH HIGHER LEVEL OFFICERS, AND EVEN IF A GENERAL OR
COLONEL IS INVOLVED, (THE CULPRITS) MUST BE PUNISHED," HE POINTED OUT.

   HE ADDED: "WE HOPE THAT IT WILL NOT BE AS IN THE PAST WHEN THE MASTERMINDS
ARE PROTECTED.  AS THE SAYING GOES: THE LITTLE GUYS ALWAYS PAY."

   OCHOA SAID THAT HE IS CONVINCED THAT "INVESTIGATIONS MUST BE PURSUED" AND
THAT NOBODY SHOULD RECEIVE "SPECIAL TREATMENT," BECAUSE "UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE ARE ELEMENTS WHO ARE HURTING THE ARMY AND THE PRESIDENT, AND THE HIGH
COMMAND HAVE TO PURGE THEM."

   OCHOA, FORMER DEPUTY AND CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THE STATE POWER COMPANY,
DESCRIBED AS "COURAGEOUS" THE DECISION OF PRESIDENT ALFREDO CRISTIANI TO
PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES MASSACRED THE SIX JESUIT
PRIESTS AND TWO WOMEN.

   ON 7 JANUARY, CRISTIANI OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT MILITARY PERSONNEL
KILLED THE JESUITS, THEIR COOK, AND THE COOK'S 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER.

   HOWEVER, HE REFUSED TO REVEAL THE NAMES OF THOSE INVOLVED TO AVOID
HAMPERING THE INVESTIGATION.

   THE COLONEL SAID: "WE HOPE THAT THE NAMES WILL BE REVEALED SOON AND THAT
THESE PEOPLE WILL BE PUNISHED."

   OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT OCHOA'S STATEMENTS, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST AN INTERNAL
STRUGGLE WITHIN THE RULING ARENA, EXPRESS AN IMPLICIT WISH TO SEE THIS
ABOMINABLE CRIME RESOLVED."

   THE RETIRED COLONEL ADDED THAT THE "COURAGEOUS" POSITION OF CRISTIANI
REGARDING THIS CASE HAS BROUGHT HIM STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT THAT IS
HELPING TO STRENGTHEN THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS THAT THE CURRENT PRESIDENT
WANTS TO PROMOTE.

   ALTHOUGH OCHOA ADMITTED THAT IN EL SALVADOR MILITARY POWER HAS BEEN BEHIND
THE REAL POWER AND THAT TRYING A MILITARY MAN HAS BEEN TABOO, HE SAID THAT
CRISTIANI "IS DETERMINED TO INTENSIFY A PURGE OF SUCH ELEMENTS FROM THE
ARMED FORCES."

   HE ALSO ADMITTED "THAT THERE ARE STILL SALVADORAN MILITARY MEN WHO BELIEVE
THAT THEY HOLD POWER AND THAT THEY CAN USE THEIR RIFLES AND THE POWER THAT
THEIR WEAPONS GIVE THEM."

   GUATEMALA CITY, 13 JAN 90 (EFE) -- [TEXT] THE GUATEMALAN FOREIGN
MINISTRY CONDEMNED TODAY THE ASSASSINATION OF LEFTIST SALVADORAN LEADER
HECTOR OQUELI AND GUATEMALAN POLITICAL LEADER GILDA FLORES.

   BOTH BODIES WERE FOUND TODAY IN AN AREA NEAR GUATEMALA AND EL SALVADOR
BORDER AFTER THE VICTIMS WERE KIDNAPPED IN GUATEMALA CITY YESTERDAY.

   A FOREIGN MINISTRY COMMUNIQUE "REGRETS AND CONDEMNS" THE ASSASSINATION OF
OQUELI, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL FOR LATIN AMERICA
AND THE CARIBBEAN, AND DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE NATIONAL
REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT (MNR), A LEFTIST MOVEMENT IN EL SALVADOR.

   "WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DEATHS OF TWO VALUABLE PERSONS, AND WE CONDEMN THIS
ACT OF VIOLENCE," THE NOTE ADDS.

   THE DOCUMENT IS THE FIRST OFFICIAL REACTION TO THE KIDNAPPING AND
ASSASSINATION OF BOTH LEADERS.

   GILDA FLORES WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST PARTY (PSD)
OF GUATEMALA, WHOSE SECRETARY GENERAL MARIO SOLORZANO REPORTED THAT
"SALVADORAN PARAMILITARY GROUPS" ARE CARRYING OUT ACTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY.

   ACCORDING TO SOLORZANO, THE INCIDENT "SHOWS THERE IS COOPERATION BETWEEN
PARAMILITARY GROUPS OF BOTH COUNTRIES," BECAUSE THE PERPETRATORS KNEW OF
OQUELI'S ARRIVAL "AND THEY STAGED AN ENTIRE OPERATION TO KIDNAP HIM."

   THE BODIES OF THE POLITICAL LEADERS WERE FOUND EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
SHOTS THROUGH THE TEMPLE IN THE GUATEMALAN TOWN OF JALPATAGUA, NEAR THE
BORDER WITH EL SALVADOR, OQUELI'S RELATIVES TOLD EFE IN EL SALVADOR.

   OQUELI ARRIVED IN GUATEMALA LAST THURSDAY.  ON FRIDAY MORNING, WHILE ON
HIS WAY TO LA AURORA AIRPORT TO CATCH A PLANE TO NICARAGUA, HE WAS KIDNAPPED
BY "HEAVILY ARMED MEN," ACCORDING TO THE MNR.

   PANAMA CITY (PANAMA), 26 JAN 89 -- [TEXT] EXPLOSIVES LOADED IN A
SMALL TRUCK, WHICH WERE GOING TO BE FIRED AT THE SALVADORAN
PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE, WERE DEACTIVATED AT NOON TODAY, A MILITARY SOURCE
HAS REPORTED.

   THREE HANDMADE CATAPULTS, EACH LOADED WITH APPROXIMATELY 7 KG OF
DYNAMITE, WERE DEFUSED AT 1145 (1745 GMT) BY NATIONAL POLICEMEN.  THE
CATAPULTS WERE LOCATED 200 METERS FROM THE PRESIDENCY AND WERE TO BE FIRED
10 MINUTES LATER, COPREFA REPORTED.

   ACCORDING TO THE GUERRILLAS, THE "MOBILE ARMED PLATFORMS," SORT OF LIKE
MEDIEVAL CATAPULTS, CONSIST OF TWO PARTS: A FUSE AND A MAIN CHARGE.

   THE PRESIDENTIAL HOUSE IS LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF SAL SALVADOR
ADJACENT TO ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL GARRISONS OF EL SALVADOR, THE ARMED
FORCES TRANSMISSION CENTER.

   IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE FMLN HAS USED SO-CALLED "MOBILE ARMED
PLATFORMS" AGAINST THE PRINCIPAL ARMY GARRISONS IN SAN SALVADOR.

   THE ARMY DESCRIBED THESE DEVICES AS "TERRORIST WEAPONS" AND LABELED THEM
"CAR BOMBS."

   SAN SALVADOR, 6 FEB 89 -- [REPORT] [MARCO ANTONIO GUEVARA] [TEXT] ON A
NATIONAL RADIO AND TELEVISION NETWORK LAST NIGHT, THE GOVERNMENT REVEALED
THE RESULTS OF A NUMBER OF INVESTIGATIONS ON THE MURDER OF MSGR ARNULFO
ROMERO; HOWEVER, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID AT NOON TODAY ONLY THE FOURTH
CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THE EVIDENCE AGAINST ANY PERSON
IS LEGAL:

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] SINCE I
DO NOT KNOW THEIR CONTENT, I CANNOT GIVE AN OPINION ON THE MATTER.
HOWEVER, IF FROM THOSE RECORDS OR THE VIDEO ONE CAN DETERMINE THERE IS
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THE CRIME COMMITTED AGAINST MSGR ROMERO, I
WILL UNQUESTIONABLY REQUEST THAT EVIDENCE AND SUBMIT IT IMMEDIATELY TO THE
FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT.  I BELIEVE EVIDENCE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO SPECULATE
OR SHOULD NOT BE PUBLICLY PROMOTED.  IF PERTINENT EVIDENCE EXISTS, IT MUST
BE SUBMITTED TO THE CORRESPONDING JUDGE, WHO IS THE EXCLUSIVE LEGAL
AUTHORITY TO DEAL WITH IT AND, AFTER AN EXHAUSTIVE ANALYSIS, DETERMINE THE
VALIDITY OF THE EVIDENCE. [END RECORDING]

   NEVERTHELESS, MSGR ROMERO'S CASE HAS BEGUN TO HAVE THE ELEMENTS IT HAD
LACKED FOR MORE THAN 8 YEARS.  THE LEGAL EVIDENCE MUST CONTAIN A SERIES OF
CONDITIONS, AND ONLY THE JUDGE CAN DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE VALUE OR
NOT.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE VIDEO
FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT EVIDENCE.  THE CONTENTS OF THE VIDEO MUST BE REAFFIRMED
BY THE PERSONS WHO IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER PARTICIPATED IN THE PREPARATION,
AND THE ACCURACY OF THE CONTENTS NARRATED IN THAT VIDEO MUST BE LEGALLY
DETERMINED. [END RECORDING]

   GARCIA ALVARADO ADDED THAT THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE DECIDED A FEW
HOURS AGO TO SUMMON FORMER ATTORNEY ROBERTO GIRON FLORES AND THE OFFICIALS
JULIO ALFREDO SAMAYOA AND GERARDO LE CHEVALIER TO GIVE THE EVIDENCE THEY
CLAIM TO HAVE ON THE CASE.  BECAUSE THEY ARE OFFICIALS, THE LATTER TWO MUST
MAKE SWORN STATEMENTS.

   [BEGIN RECORDING] [ATTORNEY GENERAL ROBERTO GARCIAL ALVARADO] THE JUDGE
IN CHARGE OF THE CASE HAS ISSUED RESOLUTIONS ORDERING THE SUMMONS OF IVON
FLORES AND SWORN STATEMENTS FROM THE TWO OFFICIALS MENTIONED. [END
RECORDING]

   THESE NEW RESOLUTIONS OF THE FOURTH CRIMINAL COURT JUDGE ON MSGR
ROMERO'S CASE WERE ISSUED AT THE REQUEST OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE,
WHICH DEMONSTRATES, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID, THAT HE IS NOT AN
UNDERTAKER OF TRIALS, MUCH LESS OF PEOPLE.

   VICE PRESIDENT ANTONIO CASTILLO CLARAMOUNT SAID THE SUPREME COURT OF
JUSTICE HAS THE MORAL OBLIGATION TO PUNISH THE MURDERERS OF MSGR ROMERO,
INCLUDING MAJOR ROBERTO D'AUBUISSON.  THE VICE PRESIDENT ALSO INSISTED THE
LEGISLATIVE ASSEMBLY HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE THAT THOSE GUILTY OF THE
MURDER OF MSGR ROMERO BE PUNISHED.  HOWEVER, HE STRESSED THE SUPREME COURT
MUST ACT.  HE SAID THE INVESTIGATION MUST CONTINUE AND GATHER ALL THE
EVIDENCE TO SOLVE THIS CASE, WHICH OCCURRED IN MARCH 1980.
